#Take input of first name 
first = input('Enter your first name:')
#Take input of last name 
last = input('Enter your last name:')
#Print out last name 'space' first name
print(last, first)

#Take input of int
n = int(input('Enter integar:'))
#Create formula to find sum of n, n*n, and n*n*n
value = n+n*n+n*n*n
#Print value
print(value)

#Take input of home country
country = input('What country are you from?')
#Print response
print('I have heard that', country, 'is a beautiful country!')

#Result of Exercise 4: Nothing prints

#Exercise 5: The output of this code is [10, 20, 30, 40] [10, 20, 30, 40] (on two lines)
#We get this result because adding to an array appends the added array and the end and the
#+= operator adds something to the variable then sets the variable to be the new sum
#a is also changed because by setting b to a we have both a and b point to the same term and its that term that we change

#Result of Exercise 6: The output is 2.  The % operator is the remainder operator and it functions by returning whatever number 
#remains after you evenly divide the first number by the second.  In this case 6 goes into 2 zero times and there is 2 leftover

#Result of Exercise 7: The output is 216.  We use two operators here * which is multiplication and ** which is exponentials

#Exercise 8: A text editor is anything like word or notepad where you can format text

#Exercise 9: Python is an object oriented coding language often used in education or science oriented programming that has 
#been referred to as almost pseudo code due to its easy readability

#Exercise 10: Jupyter Notebook is an integrated developement environment that's incredibly flexible and has a useful structure 
#data science collaboration.  I believe the environment is conda.  Some alternatives are PyCharm and Eclipse
